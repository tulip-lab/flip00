    "In [another notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Probability.ipynb) I showed how to solve problems by computing probabilities. The computations are simple: count the frequency of the \"favorable\" outcomes and divide by the frequency of all possible outcomes&mdash;the \"sample space.\" (In [yet another notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Probability.ipynb) I tackle some probability paradoxes.)\n",

    "Consider [problem 84](https://projecteuler.net/problem=84) from the excellent [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), which asks for the probability that a player in the game Monopoly ends a roll on each of the squares on the board.  To answer this we need to take into account die rolls, chance and community chest cards, and going to jail (from the \"go to jail\" space, from a card, or from rolling doubles three times in a row). We do not need to take into account anything about acquiring properties or exchanging money or winning or losing the game, because these events don't change a player's location. \n",
    "\n",
    "A game of Monopoly can go on forever, so the sample space is infinite. Even if we limit the sample space to say, 1000 rolls, there are $21^{1000}$ such sequences of rolls. So it is infeasible to explicitly represent the sample space. There are techniques for representing the problem as\n",
    "a Markov decision problem (MDP) and solving it, but the math is complex (a [paper](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~bishop/monopoly.pdf) on the subject runs 15 pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest approach is to implement a simulation and run it for, say, a million rolls.  Below is the code for a simulation. Squares are represented by integers from 0 to 39, and we define a global variable for each square: `GO`, `A1` (for the first property in the first monopoly), `CC1` (the first community chest square), and so on.  Wiithin the function `monopoly` the variable `loc` keeps track of where we are, and dice rolls and cards can alter the location. We use `visits[square]` to count how many times we end a roll on the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trickiest part of the simulation is the cards: chance and community chest. We'll implement a deck of cards as a double-ended queue (so we can take cards from the top and put them on the bottom). Each card can be:\n",
    "- A square, meaning to advance to that square (e.g., `R1` (square 5) means \"take a ride on the Reading\").\n",
    "- A set of cards (e.g., `{R1, R2, R3, R4}` means \"advance to nearest railroad\").\n",
    "- The number -3, which means \"go back 3 squares\".\n",
    "- `'$'`, meaning the card has no effect on location, but involves money.\n",

They can choose to keep that first number, or to press the button again to discard the first number and get a second random number, which they must keep. Then, they come out of their booths and see the final number for each player on the wall. The lavish grand prize — a case full of gold bullion — is awarded to the player who kept the higher number. Which number is the optimal cutoff for players to discard their first number and choose another?
