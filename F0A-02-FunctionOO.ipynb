    "## 3.4. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inheritance* helps reuse of code, and is one of the most important features of object oriented programming. Inheritance can be best imagined as implementing a type and subtype relationship between classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you need to write a program to keep track of the information of the teachers and students. They have some common characteristics such as name and age, while also have specific characteristics such as salary for teachers, and marks for students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating two independent classes for each type, a better way is to create a common class call **SchoolMember**, \n",
    "and then have the **Teacher** and **Student** classes inherit from this class. \n",
    "There are many advantages to this approach. \n",
    "If we add/change any functionality in **SchoolMember**, \n",
    "this is automatically reflected in the subtypes. \n",
    "However, changes in the subtypes do not affect other subtypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that we   can refer to a **Teacher** \n",
    "or **Student** object as a **SchoolMember** object. \n",
    "This is called *polymorphism* where a sub-type can\n",
    "be substituted in any situation where a parent type is expected,\n",
    "i.e. the object can be\n",
    "treated as an instance of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "With inheritance, we can reuse the code of the parent class and do not need to repeat it in the different class. The **SchoolMember** class in this situation is called the *base class* or *super class*. The **Teacher** and **Student** classes are called the *subclasses*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to define and use superclass and subclass.  "
