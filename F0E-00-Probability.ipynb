Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game. Thus, I believe the following list of possible endings to the game is exhaustive. I have denoted 'heads' by an 'h', and tails by a 't.' I have starred the outcomes that indicate a win for myself.\n",

They can choose to keep that first number, or to press the button again to discard the first number and get a second random number, which they must keep.

We can think of this as a two-dimensional sample space of points in the (*a*, *b*) plane, where *a* ranges from the cutoff *A* to 1 and *b* ranges from the cutoff B to 1.
